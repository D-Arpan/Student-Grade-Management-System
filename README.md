# Student Grades Management System

## Overview
This is a **Python-based Student Grades Management System** that allows users to add, update, delete, and view student grades through a simple menu-driven interface.

## Features
- Add a new student with a grade
- Update a student's grade
- Delete a student from the system
- View all students and their grades
- Exit the program

## How It Works
1. The program runs an **interactive menu**.
2. The user selects an operation:
   - **1**: Add a student
   - **2**: Update a student's grade
   - **3**: Delete a student
   - **4**: View all students
   - **5**: Exit the program
3. The loop continues until the user selects the **Exit** option.
